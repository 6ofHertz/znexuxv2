# Session Log (Private - Local Only)

> **This file is in .gitignore and stays on your machine only**  
> **Purpose:** Track real-time progress during active development sessions

## 🕐 Current Session

**Started:** Session in progress  
**Focus:** Progress tracking system implementation  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Actions Taken This Session
- ✅ Created main PROGRESS.md (version controlled, clones with repo)
- ✅ Created .session-log.md (local only, in .gitignore)
- ✅ Built auto-update script (scripts/analyze-progress.js)
- ✅ Added npm script: `npm run update-progress`
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to exclude session log
- ✅ Created comprehensive PROGRESS_TRACKING_GUIDE.md
- ✅ Tested auto-update functionality

### Files Modified
- ✅ Created: `PROGRESS.md`
- ✅ Created: `.session-log.md`
- ✅ Created: `scripts/analyze-progress.js`
- ✅ Created: `PROGRESS_TRACKING_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ Modified: `.gitignore`
- ✅ Modified: `package.json` (added update-progress script)

### How It Works
1. **PROGRESS.md** - Main tracked file (clones with repo, auto-updates from git history)
2. **.session-log.md** - Private notes (stays local, never committed)
3. **scripts/analyze-progress.js** - Analyzes git commits and updates PROGRESS.md
4. **npm run update-progress** - Command to refresh progress from git history

### System Features
✅ Main progress file clones with project  
✅ Auto-generates stats from git commits  
✅ Categorizes changes (features, fixes, docs)  
✅ Private session log for personal notes  
✅ Preserves manual sections during updates  
✅ Works for anyone who clones the repo

## 📝 Quick Notes

**What user wanted:**
- Progress document that updates as I code
- Should be in git so it clones with project
- Should auto-update based on changes
- Wasn't sure about .gitignore vs tracked file

**Solution provided:**
- PROGRESS.md = tracked (everyone sees it)
- .session-log.md = local only (private notes)
- Auto-update script analyzes git history
- Best of both worlds approach
